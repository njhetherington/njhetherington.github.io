# Undergraduate Projects

## UAV Indoor Guidance System
*4th Year Undergraduate Capstone Project*<br>
I co-designed and implemented a control system for a quadrotor UAV to follow walls and traverse corners.<br>
<br>
We augmented an off-the-shelf drone with SONAR sensors and an Arduino microcontroller:<br>

<br>
We designed a pose control system using a PI controller:<br>

<br>
We implemented the control system using ROS and Python:<br>

* We placed 3rd at the 2017 IEEE Eastern Ontario Student Paper Competition (Ottawa, ON).

## Electrical Design Lead and Project Manager - Queen's Mostly Autonomous Sailboat Team
I was part of the Queen's Most Autonomous Sailboat Team (QMAST) for three years:
* In the summer of 2014 I did a co-op term as the Electrical Design Lead.
* In my third year (2014/2015) I was the Electrical Team co-manager as a volunteer extra-curricular.
* We placed 2nd at the 2015 International Robotic Sailing Regatta (St. John's NL).
